This file contains a very early version of a portfolio of my projects. It features sections that are styled with flex boxes and background images. It will eventually showcase a responsive layout that formats to the specific device this page is viewed on. It will also eventually contain links on the project images that will redirect the user to live applications. 
All elements are established with semantic HTML elements and are supplemented by a CSS stylesheet.
